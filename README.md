# DIPLOMACY 4.3+ STEAM FOR MOUNT AND BLADE 1.174  (FORK)

Forked from 
[1.174 Updates](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/285119009/451850849180281143/) from May 2019

with some fixes, some from the Taleworlds forum

* Lords return more reliably from exile
* Can spar with your army in the arena
* Prisoners in your party do not disappear while selling those in your garrison to the constable
* No crazy charge in battle of your party (they await your orders)
* Body guards
* Import / Export companions
* Whistle for your horse (key M)
* Taunt your opponents, so that they will attack you (key O)

## Credits

Many to keep track of

* the Diplomacy mod maintainers (Waihti, hessuu, fisheye, rubik, jrider, Mjollnir, Akmar Nibelung, Parsifal, Somebody) 
* and other Taleworlds  forum users: Dj_FRedy, Jinnai, lazeras, Caba`dr, Glabrezu, Efe Karaca


## On Nexus

A compiled version of this mod can be found on Nexus: https://www.nexusmods.com/mbwarband/mods/6309

## Branching Policy

On Master there should be changes which do not break compatibility with 4.3+ Stem for 1.174
On Develop and possibly other release branches should go breaking changes, to be named differently (Diplomacy 5.0 if I can pull it off, or some other name)
