# DIPLOMACY 4.3+ STEAM FOR MOUNT AND BLADE 1.174  (FORK)

Forked from 
[1.174 Updates](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/285119009/451850849180281143/) from May 2019.
Note that the base version has not been released from the author yet, so it may contain bugs. Feel free to add issues and code changes proposals.
Some additions

* Can spar with your army in the arena
* Prisoners in your party do not disappear while selling those in your garrison to the constable
* No crazy charge in battle of your party (they await your orders)
* Body guards
* Import / Export companions
* Whistle for your horse (key M)
* Taunt your opponents, so that they will attack you (key O)

## Credits

Many to keep track of

* the Diplomacy mod maintainers (Waihti, hessuu, fisheye, rubik, jrider, Mjollnir, Akmar Nibelung, Parsifal, Somebody) 
* and other Taleworlds  forum users: Dj_FRedy, Jinnai, lazeras, Caba`dr, Glabrezu, Efe Karaca


## Branching Policy

On **master** there should be changes which do not break compatibility with 4.3+ Steam for 1.174.

The branch **somebody_ver** at the moment tracks the official version of this mod, maintained by Somebody.

On **develop** and possibly other release branches there might be changes that will break downward compatibility with the official version.
